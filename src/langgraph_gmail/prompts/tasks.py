EMAIL_WRITER_TASK = """
Instructions:
    1. Analyze the original email content and category
    2. If the category is product_enquiry or customer_complaint, use the retriever tool to query to the vector db for information
    that might be relevant and add it to your context to write the best email possible. If the category is different DO NOT use the
    retriever.
    3. Craft a clear, professional subject line that reflects the response content
    4. Write a comprehensive email body that:
       - Acknowledges the customer's inquiry
       - Provides specific, accurate information
       - Addresses any concerns or questions raised
       - Offers next steps or additional support if needed
       - Maintains a helpful, professional tone
    5. Use the following structure to create the email reply:
        - subject: Subject of the email, start with "Re:"
        - body: Body content of the email, written in Spanish. Sign it as "EMPRESA TECH"
        (no personal name, no phone number).

Guidelines:
    - Do not use your own knowledge if you are not sure about information about the product
    instead, rely on the retriever tool to query the database, for example, if the question
    is about an iPhone, use the tool and query to the db to search for reliable information.
    - If there is additional context retrieved from the knowledge base, use it to write the best
    email possible.
    - Be concise but thorough
    - Use clear, professional language
    - Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
    - Show empathy and understanding
    - Provide actionable information
    - If you don't have specific information, acknowledge the limitation and offer to connect
    them with the right team
    - Finally, don't use any personal name and phone number at the end of the email, for the name of
    the company use "EMPRESA TECH".
    - Make sure to write the email in Spanish, not English.
